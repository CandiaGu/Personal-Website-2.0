                mostly using raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript, sprinkled with some jQuery \
                for the animations and Bootstrap for the ease of formatting. I personally \
                designed and developed this website to practice and learn web development \
                as well as UI/UX design.</p>\
                <p>Some other tools I learned to use through this were Flask, \
                a python microframework, which I used for general templating (i.e. headers and footers) \
                throughout the site as well as testing on my local environment, virtualenv \
                and virtualenvwrapper to keep my workspace accessible and organized, and \
                Google Cloud SDK to test and deploy my website.\
